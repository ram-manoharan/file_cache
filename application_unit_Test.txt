Functionality cases :
=====================

1. Spawn single writer and reader thread - check reader1.out.txt file is properly populated and item_list file is properly updated.
2. Spawn 2 writer threads (with different position updates) and 1 reader thread - check reader1.out.txt file is properly populated and item_list file is properly updated.
3. Spawn  2 writer threads (with overlapping position updates) and 1 reader thread - check reader1.out.txt file is properly populated and item_list file is properly updated.
4. Spawn 2 writer threads and 2 reader threads (with different position reads) and check the behaviour.
5. Spawn 2 writer threads and 2 reader threads (with overlapping  position reads) and check the behaviour.
6. Spawn writer and reader threads with overlapping positions and check "dirty cache" scenario. 
7. Reduce the cache size much lower than the actual data size and check the behaviour.
8. Read more unique data than cache size and verify LRU eviction.
9. Overwrite the position which is already available in cache, with fully populated cache  and verify eviction is not triggered.

Stability/Robustness cases :
===========================

1. Run application with empty reader_list_file and proper write_list_file  - check no reader thread is spawned and application is stable.
2. Run application with empty reader1.txt and proper write_list_file  - check  reader thread is spawned and application is stable.
3. Run application with empty write_list_file and proper reader_list_file - check no writer thread is spawned and application is stable.
4. Run application with empty writer1.txt file and proper reader_list_file - check  writer thread is spawned and application is stable.
5. Run application with empty item_list file.
6. Run application with item_list file with line spaces.
7. Run application with invalid item_list file.
8. Run application with invalid read_list file.
9. Run application with invalid write_list file.
10. Run application with invalid position in read file.
11. Run application with empty read_list and empty write_list files and check the application is quitting gracefully.


Scale/Performance cases:
=======================

1. Spawn 100 reader threads and 1 writer thread and check the performance("READ-HEAVY scenario").
2. Spawn 100 writer threads and 1 reader thread and check the performance(WRITE-HEAVY scenario).
3. spawn 100 reader annd 100 writer threa and check for the behaviour.
4. Spawn 100 writer threds and verify that item_list file is not corrupted.
